# NHM_image_data
Some experimental scripts for automating download, segmentation and analysis of images on NHM data portal

LBP comparison - generates a texture-based matrix of euclidean distances for some Biston betularia samples. Performed quite well with the right parameters.

Grab_NHM_abs.py/(NHM.py) - access and parse metadata from NHM

auto_detect_specimen.py - good but not perfect yet
